Too make tree json, you have to run stanford core nlp tree parser.

We provide example code(StanfordCoreNlpTreeAdder.java) for it.

You have to run StanfordCoreNlpTreeAdder.java with json-simple-1.1.1.jar by importing it.

Because, StanfordCoreNLP is too slow and sometimes it gives exception, we provide

spliter of our data and merger too.

If you met exception, you should retrying, so if you set split num (in spliter_for_parser.py) as large number you will waste your time.

We don't understand why exception happens randomly. If you know please let us know it will be very helpful.
